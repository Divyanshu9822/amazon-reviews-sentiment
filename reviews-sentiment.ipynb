    "In this notebook, we successfully developed an Amazon Sentiment Analyzer empowered by Google's Gemini-Pro AI model. The tool accepts an Amazon product link as input, extracts some details from the product page, and employs the Gemini-Pro AI model to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews.\n",

    "**Key Achievements:**\n",
    "1. **Product Details:** Succesfully extracted some product details like title, price, ratings and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic URL Construction:** Overcame challenges posed by varying review page URLs by implementing a method to construct a unique URL, accommodating both paginated and non-paginated structures.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Gemini-Pro AI Integration:** Leveraged Google's Gemini-Pro AI model for sentiment analysis, enhancing the accuracy and depth of our review evaluations.\n",
